This folder contains some non-sensitive documentation of varying complexity that I wrote in my time as a CyberArk operations consultant at Dubex. Some of it is copy-pasted from the official docs for reference and some of it has been written with love over months of research.

Markdown rendering screws with the formatting of these docs. I recommend reading the docs in raw/code format on Github instead of their preview/rendered markdown.

# Upgrade CyberArk Core PAS
Read "_ Upgrade CyberArk Core PAS" first and then the "Change - " files later. Alternatively, you can read the "MERGED - Upgrade CyberArk Core PAS" file, which just has it all merged into one PDF.
